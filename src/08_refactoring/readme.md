# Refactoring

## book: Refactoring by Martin Fowler
> Tip 1: When you have to add a feature to a program, but the code is not structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.
> Tip 2: Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be able to catch any regression errors that may occur during refactoring and must be self-checking.
