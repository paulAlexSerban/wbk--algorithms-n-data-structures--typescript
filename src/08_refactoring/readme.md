# Refactoring

## (book): Refactoring by Martin Fowler

### Note 1: 
>   Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence, when you refactor, you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.
### Note 2: 
>   When you have to add a feature to a program, but the code is not structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.
### Note 3: 
>   Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of self-checking tests. These tests must be able to catch any regression errors that may occur during refactoring.

### Note 4:
>  Refactoring changes the program in small steps. If you make a mistake, it is easy to find the bug.

### Note 5:
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
