## Inversion of Control (IoC)

- IoC is a principle where the control flow of a program is inverted compared to traditional programming. In traditional programming, the custom code that you write makes calls to a library or framework, whereas with IoC, the framework calls into the custom code.
- IoC is a broad principle that can be implemented in several ways, such as through event handling, template methods, and more prominently, dependency injection.
- IoC serves as the foundation for frameworks, especially in modern software development, where frameworks call user-defined components or code based on specific events or configurations.
