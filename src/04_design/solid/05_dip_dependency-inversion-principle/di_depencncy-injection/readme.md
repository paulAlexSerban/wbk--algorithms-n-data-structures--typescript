## Dependency Injection (DI)

-   DI is a specific form of IoC where dependencies (services or objects that a class needs to perform its function) are provided to the class rather than created by the class itself. DI can be done through constructor injection, property injection, or method injection.
-   DI is used for managing and configuring components in large software systems. It makes code more modular and testable by decoupling the instantiation of dependencies from the class's business logic.
-   DI is commonly used in combination with IoC containers, which automate the process of supplying objects with their dependencies. These containers manage object creation and lifecycle based on configuration or metadata.
