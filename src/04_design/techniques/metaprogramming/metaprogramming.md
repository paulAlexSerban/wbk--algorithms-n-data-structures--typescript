Metaprogramming
ðŸ”¹ Definition: Writing code that modifies or generates other code dynamically.
ðŸ”¹ Goal: Increase flexibility and reduce repetitive code.
ðŸ”¹ Examples:

JavaScript Proxies â†’ Intercept object operations dynamically.
Python Decorators â†’ Modify function behavior without modifying the function itself.
TypeScript Reflection (Reflect API) â†’ Dynamically inspect and modify objects.
ðŸ“Œ How it's related to IoC:
IoC frameworks often use metaprogramming to inject dependencies at runtime.
