Component-Based Architecture
ğŸ”¹ Definition: Building software as self-contained, reusable components that interact through well-defined interfaces.
ğŸ”¹ Goal: Increase reusability and flexibility.
ğŸ”¹ Examples:

React Components â†’ Independent, reusable UI components.
Web Components â†’ Encapsulated HTML, CSS, and JS.
Micro Frontends â†’ Breaking a frontend into small, independent pieces.
ğŸ“Œ How it's related to IoC:
IoC helps component-based design by allowing components to receive dependencies dynamically instead of creating them.
