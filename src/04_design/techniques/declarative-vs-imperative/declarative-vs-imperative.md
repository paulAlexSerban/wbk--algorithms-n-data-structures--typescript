Declarative vs. Imperative Programming
ðŸ”¹ Definition:

Declarative: Describes what should happen.
Imperative: Describes how it should happen.
ðŸ”¹ Goal: Increase code clarity and maintainability.
ðŸ”¹ Examples:
SQL vs. Loops: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18 (declarative) vs. iterating over a list manually (imperative).
React vs. Vanilla JS: React's JSX describes the UI (declarative), whereas document.createElement() manipulates the DOM directly (imperative).
ðŸ“Œ How it's related to IoC:
IoC shifts control away from imperative code, making systems more declarative.
