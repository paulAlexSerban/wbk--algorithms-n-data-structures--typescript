Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
ðŸ”¹ Definition: Separates cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security) from core logic.
ðŸ”¹ Goal: Improve modularity by keeping unrelated concerns out of business logic.
ðŸ”¹ Examples:

Logging & Monitoring â†’ Instead of adding logging manually, a separate module handles it.
Security (JWT Authentication Middleware) â†’ Authentication is applied globally rather than in each function.
Performance Metrics â†’ Injected dynamically instead of modifying core logic.
ðŸ“Œ How it's related to IoC:
IoC and AOP both reduce direct dependencies and help with maintainability.

ðŸ“Œ IoC Implementation: Separates cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) from core logic.
ðŸ”¹ How to Use in Code:

Middleware (Express.js, NestJS)
Decorators (TypeScript)

âœ… Example (Logging as Middleware in Express.js):
```ts
import express from "express";
const app = express();

function loggerMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`Request received: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
}

app.use(loggerMiddleware); // IoC: Middleware intercepts request

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running"));
```

âœ… Example (Logging Decorator in TypeScript):

```ts
function Log(target: any, key: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const original = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${key} with`, args);
    return original.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class UserService {
  @Log
  createUser(name: string) {
    console.log(`User ${name} created`);
  }
}

const userService = new UserService();
userService.createUser("Alice");
```
