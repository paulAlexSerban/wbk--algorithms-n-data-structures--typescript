Separation of Concerns (SoC)
ðŸ”¹ Definition: Breaking a system into distinct sections where each section addresses a separate concern.
ðŸ”¹ Goal: Reduce complexity by isolating different functionalities.
ðŸ”¹ Examples:

MVC (Model-View-Controller) â†’ Separates data (Model), presentation (View), and logic (Controller).
Layered Architecture â†’ UI, Business Logic, Data Access layers.
Microservices â†’ Each service has a single responsibility.
ðŸ“Œ How it's related to IoC:
IoC helps achieve SoC by decoupling dependencies, letting different concerns interact in a loosely coupled way.
