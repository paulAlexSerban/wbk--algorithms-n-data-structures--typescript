# SRP - Single Responsability Principle
- a class/component should have:
  - only one reason to change
  - only one responsibility
  - only one job
  - only one purpose
  - only one role
  - only one task
  - only one function
  - only one thing to do

Example:
- a Customer class should only be responsible for customer related tasks such as managing customer data, and not for other tasks such as managing orders or products.
