## LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
- sub-types must be substitutable for their base types
- derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types
- concrete implementations must adhere to the expected interface contracts
- if Bird is a class and Duck is a sub-class, wherever bird is used, Duc can also be used
