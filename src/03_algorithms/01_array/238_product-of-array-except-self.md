# Product of array except self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 

Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# MERN Project Ideas
Some use-case ideas for MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) projects that can implement the "product of array except self" algorithm:

### 1. E-commerce Platform with Price Calculations
**Description:**
Build an e-commerce platform where you need to calculate the discounted price of products based on various promotional rules. One of the rules could involve calculating the total cost of items in a cart, excluding a specific item (for buy X get Y free offers).

**Implementation:**
- Backend API with Node.js and Express to handle product data and cart operations.
- MongoDB to store product details, cart information, and user data.
- React frontend to display products, cart, and apply discount calculations.

**Usage of Algorithm:**
When a user adds products to their cart, use the "product of array except self" algorithm to calculate the total price with specific promotional rules applied.

### 2. Financial Portfolio Tracker
**Description:**
Create a financial portfolio tracking app where users can add their investments and see the performance of their portfolio excluding the impact of a single investment.

**Implementation:**
- Backend API with Node.js and Express to manage user portfolios and investment data.
- MongoDB to store user data and investment records.
- React frontend to display portfolio performance and individual investment details.

**Usage of Algorithm:**
To show the performance of the portfolio excluding a specific investment, use the algorithm to calculate the total value and exclude the selected investment's impact.

### 3. Social Media Analytics Dashboard
**Description:**
Develop a social media analytics dashboard that helps users understand the engagement metrics of their posts, excluding the influence of a specific post.

**Implementation:**
- Backend API with Node.js and Express to gather and process social media data.
- MongoDB to store user profiles, posts, and engagement metrics.
- React frontend to visualize analytics and provide insights.

**Usage of Algorithm:**
Use the algorithm to calculate total engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) while excluding the data from a particular post to understand its unique impact.

### 4. Online Learning Platform with Performance Analysis
**Description:**
Build an online learning platform where students can track their progress and performance in different courses. The platform could provide an analysis of their performance excluding the results of a particular course.

**Implementation:**
- Backend API with Node.js and Express to handle user data, course information, and performance metrics.
- MongoDB to store user profiles, course details, and performance data.
- React frontend to display courses, user progress, and performance analysis.

**Usage of Algorithm:**
When displaying overall performance, use the algorithm to exclude the results of a specific course to give insights on performance without that course.

### 5. Health and Fitness Tracker
**Description:**
Create a health and fitness tracker app that monitors various activities (e.g., running, cycling, swimming) and calculates the overall fitness score, excluding the impact of a specific activity.

**Implementation:**
- Backend API with Node.js and Express to manage user activities and fitness data.
- MongoDB to store user profiles, activities, and health metrics.
- React frontend to display activity logs, health metrics, and fitness score.

**Usage of Algorithm:**
To provide a comprehensive fitness score while excluding a specific activity, use the algorithm to calculate the total impact of all activities except the chosen one.

### 6. Budget Management Application
**Description:**
Develop a budget management application that helps users track their expenses and savings. The app could analyze the budget by excluding a specific category of expenses (e.g., entertainment).

**Implementation:**
- Backend API with Node.js and Express to manage user budgets and transaction data.
- MongoDB to store user profiles, transaction records, and budget categories.
- React frontend to display budget summaries, expense charts, and financial analysis.

**Usage of Algorithm:**
When analyzing budget data, use the algorithm to exclude the expenses of a specific category to see how the budget would look without those expenses.

These project ideas not only provide practical use-cases for the "product of array except self" algorithm but also cover various domains, making them versatile and interesting to implement.
