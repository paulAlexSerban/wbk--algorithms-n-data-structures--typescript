# Key Questions and Requirements the Solution Should Answer

Before choosing a solution that involves merging two sorted arrays and finding the median using sorting (like the `findMedianSortedArrays` function provided), it's crucial to consider several questions to ensure the approach is appropriate and meets the problem requirements effectively:

### 1. Is Sorting Acceptable Given the Problem Constraints?
- **Question:** Does the problem allow sorting as part of the solution, considering potential time complexity implications?
- **Reason:** Sorting has an average time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \). Ensure this meets the problem's performance requirements, especially for large input sizes.

### 2. Can Both Input Arrays Fit into Memory Simultaneously?
- **Question:** Are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2` manageable within memory limits when concatenated into `mergedArray`?
- **Reason:** Concatenating and sorting the merged array requires additional space equivalent to the sum of the two input arrays. Ensure this fits within memory constraints.

### 3. Is Finding the Median Accurate for Both Even and Odd Length Arrays?
- **Question:** Does the problem require handling both even and odd length arrays appropriately to compute the median?
- **Reason:** The method used in `findMedianSortedArrays` computes the median differently based on whether the merged array length is even or odd. Verify if this behavior aligns with the problem's requirements.

### 4. Does the Problem Specify Sorted Input Arrays?
- **Question:** Are `nums1` and `nums2` guaranteed to be sorted as input, or is sorting required as part of the solution?
- **Reason:** The solution assumes sorted input arrays. If not guaranteed, additional sorting logic or a different approach may be necessary.

### 5. Are There Constraints on Time Complexity?
- **Question:** Are there specific requirements or constraints on the time complexity of the solution?
- **Reason:** Sorting can be expensive in terms of time complexity, especially for large datasets. Ensure the \( O(n \log n) \) complexity of sorting is acceptable for the problem's scale.

### Example Consideration:

- **Example Problem:** Given two sorted arrays, find the median of the merged array.
- **Requirement Analysis:** Confirming that sorting is permissible and that the input arrays are manageable in size and memory is crucial. Understanding whether the solution's time complexity aligns with performance expectations ensures the approach is suitable for solving the problem efficiently.

### Conclusion:

By addressing these questions, you can assess whether using a solution that involves merging sorted arrays and finding the median through sorting is appropriate for your problem. Understanding the problem constraints, performance requirements, and potential limitations of the solution helps ensure an effective and efficient approach.
