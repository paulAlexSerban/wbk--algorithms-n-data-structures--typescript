# Remove Element

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:
0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100

### Implementation Tips
1. **Backend (Node.js and Express)**:
    - Define RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations.
    - Use the `removeElement` function in your controller functions to process arrays before saving them to the database or returning them to the client.
    - Ensure proper error handling and validation.

2. **Frontend (React)**:
    - Create components to interact with the backend API and manage state.
    - Implement forms for creating and updating entities (tasks, products, events, etc.).
    - Use state management (like Redux) to handle complex state logic.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
    - Design your database schema to store the necessary information.
    - Use Mongoose for object data modeling and to interact with MongoDB from Node.js.

### Example Code Snippet
Here's an example of how you might integrate the `removeElement` function into an Express controller:

```javascript
// controllers/tasksController.js
import { removeElement } from './utils'; // Import the function

// Example function to remove completed tasks
export const removeCompletedTasks = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const userId = req.user.id; // Assuming user ID is stored in the request object
        const userTasks = await Task.find({ userId });
        
        const taskIds = userTasks.map(task => task.id);
        const activeTasks = taskIds.filter(task => !task.completed);

        const k = removeElement(taskIds, activeTasks);
        await Task.updateOne({ userId }, { tasks: activeTasks.slice(0, k) });
        
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Completed tasks removed', activeTasks: activeTasks.slice(0, k) });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
    }
};
```

By integrating the `removeElement` function into various project ideas, you can effectively manage arrays of data and provide robust functionality for your users.
