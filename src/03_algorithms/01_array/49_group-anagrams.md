# Group Anagrams Problem
> neetCode - https://neetcode.io/problems/anagram-groups
> LeetCode 49 - https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/ 

The problem is to group anagrams from a list of strings. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. The task is to group these anagrams together.

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - A `Map` is created to store arrays of strings. Each key in the map represents a unique "signature" of an anagram group, and the value is an array of strings that are anagrams of each other.
   ```typescript
   const map = new Map<string, string[]>();
   ```

2. **Iterate through each string in the input array**:
   - For each string `str` in the array `strs`, we generate a key that represents its anagram group. This key is generated by sorting the characters of the string and joining them back into a string.
   ```typescript
   for (let str of strs) {
     const key = str.split("").sort().join("");
   ```

3. **Update the map with the anagram groups**:
   - Check if the map already has an entry for this key. If not, create a new array for this key.
   - Push the current string into the array corresponding to this key.
   ```typescript
     if (!map.has(key)) {
       map.set(key, []);
     }
     map.get(key)?.push(str);
   ```

4. **Convert the map values to an array and return**:
   - Finally, convert the values of the map (which are arrays of anagrams) to an array and return it.
   ```typescript
   return Array.from(map.values());
   ```

### Detailed Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

```typescript
export function groupAnagrams(strs: string[]): string[][] {
  // Initialize a Map to hold the anagram groups
  const map = new Map<string, string[]>();

  // Iterate over each string in the input array
  for (let str of strs) {
    // Sort the characters of the string to create a key
    const key = str.split("").sort().join("");

    // If the key is not already in the map, add it with an empty array
    if (!map.has(key)) {
      map.set(key, []);
    }

    // Add the current string to the array corresponding to the sorted key
    map.get(key)?.push(str);
  }

  // Convert the values of the map to an array and return it
  return Array.from(map.values());
}
```

### Explanation with an Example:

**Example 1**:
- Input: `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`
- Process:
  - "eat" -> key: "aet", map: `{ "aet": ["eat"] }`
  - "tea" -> key: "aet", map: `{ "aet": ["eat", "tea"] }`
  - "tan" -> key: "ant", map: `{ "aet": ["eat", "tea"], "ant": ["tan"] }`
  - "ate" -> key: "aet", map: `{ "aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ant": ["tan"] }`
  - "nat" -> key: "ant", map: `{ "aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ant": ["tan", "nat"] }`
  - "bat" -> key: "abt", map: `{ "aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ant": ["tan", "nat"], "abt": ["bat"] }`
- Output: `Array.from(map.values())` -> `[["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]`

**Example 2**:
- Input: `[""]`
- Process:
  - "" -> key: "", map: `{ "": [""] }`
- Output: `[[""]]`

**Example 3**:
- Input: `["a"]`
- Process:
  - "a" -> key: "a", map: `{ "a": ["a"] }`
- Output: `[["a"]]`

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \cdot K \log K)\), where \(N\) is the number of strings and \(K\) is the maximum length of a string. Sorting each string takes \(O(K \log K)\), and this is done for each of the \(N\) strings.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N \cdot K)\), for storing the strings in the map.

This solution efficiently groups anagrams by leveraging the sorted string as a unique identifier for anagram groups.

## Practical MERN Project Ideas
Sure, here are five practical MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project ideas where the group anagrams solution can be utilized:

### 1. Anagram-Based Word Game
**Description**: Create a word game where users can input a list of words, and the application will group them into anagrams. Players can then challenge each other to find as many anagrams as possible within a time limit.

**Features**:
- User authentication and profiles.
- Input list of words and display grouped anagrams.
- Real-time multiplayer game mode using WebSockets.
- Leaderboards and scoring system.
- Save and retrieve game history from MongoDB.

### 2. Anagram Dictionary
**Description**: Develop a dictionary application where users can search for a word and see all its anagrams. This can be useful for linguists, writers, and Scrabble enthusiasts.

**Features**:
- User authentication and profiles.
- Search functionality to find words and their anagrams.
- Display additional information about words (definitions, usage examples).
- Allow users to add new words to the dictionary.
- Store word data and anagrams in MongoDB.

### 3. Anagram-Based Social Network
**Description**: Build a social network where users can create posts using anagrams. Users can challenge each other to create meaningful sentences or messages using anagrams of a given word.

**Features**:
- User authentication and profiles.
- Create, edit, and delete posts.
- Comment and like functionality.
- Anagram grouping for each post.
- Real-time notifications and chat using WebSockets.
- Store posts, comments, and user data in MongoDB.

### 4. Anagram Puzzles and Quizzes Platform
**Description**: Develop a platform where users can solve anagram puzzles and quizzes. Users can create and share their own puzzles, and compete with others in solving challenges.

**Features**:
- User authentication and profiles.
- Create, edit, and share anagram puzzles.
- Solve puzzles and submit answers.
- Leaderboards and scoring system.
- Store puzzles, answers, and user data in MongoDB.

### 5. Educational Anagram Tool
**Description**: Create an educational tool for teachers and students to learn vocabulary through anagrams. Teachers can create lists of words, and students can group them into anagrams as a learning exercise.

**Features**:
- User authentication and profiles for teachers and students.
- Create and manage word lists.
- Interactive interface for grouping words into anagrams.
- Progress tracking and performance analytics for students.
- Store word lists, student progress, and performance data in MongoDB.

### Implementation Notes for All Projects:
- **Backend**:
  - Use Node.js with Express.js to create RESTful APIs.
  - Implement the `groupAnagrams` function to process words and group them into anagrams.
  - Store and manage data in MongoDB.
  - Use Mongoose for MongoDB schema and data validation.

- **Frontend**:
  - Use React for building the user interface.
  - Create components for user authentication, input forms, and displaying results.
  - Use React Router for navigation between different pages.
  - Use state management libraries like Redux for managing application state.

- **Additional Features**:
  - Use JWT for authentication and authorization.
  - Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
  - Add unit tests and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

These project ideas not only leverage the `groupAnagrams` function but also provide a comprehensive learning experience with the MERN stack.
