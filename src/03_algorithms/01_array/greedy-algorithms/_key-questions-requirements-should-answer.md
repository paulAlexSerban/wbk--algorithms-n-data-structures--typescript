# Key Questions and Requirements the Solution Should Answer

Choosing a greedy algorithm involves evaluating whether its characteristics match the problem requirements to ensure it will provide an optimal or near-optimal solution. Here are the key questions your requirements should answer before opting for a greedy algorithm:

### 1. Does the Problem Exhibit Optimal Substructure?
- **Question:** Can the problem be solved by making a series of locally optimal choices?
- **Reason:** Greedy algorithms make decisions that seem best at the current moment without reconsidering past choices. Problems with optimal substructure allow greedy choices to lead to an overall optimal solution.

### 2. Can the Problem be Solved Using Greedy Choice Property?
- **Question:** Can a greedy choice at each step lead to a globally optimal solution?
- **Reason:** Greedy algorithms work by making the best possible decision at each step, without reconsidering that decision. Problems where this property holds ensure that a series of locally optimal choices lead to a globally optimal solution.

### 3. Is Greedy Algorithm Efficient for the Problem Constraints?
- **Question:** Is the problem constraint suitable for the greedy algorithmâ€™s approach?
- **Reason:** Greedy algorithms are often efficient in terms of time complexity, but they may not always provide the most optimal solution. Understanding the problem constraints helps evaluate whether a greedy algorithm will be efficient and sufficient.

### 4. Does the Problem Require Sorting or Prioritization?
- **Question:** Can the problem be simplified or solved by sorting elements based on certain criteria?
- **Reason:** Many greedy algorithms involve sorting elements or prioritizing them in a specific order to ensure the greedy choice property holds.

### 5. Is the Problem Solvable in a Single Pass?
- **Question:** Can the problem be solved efficiently with a single pass through the data?
- **Reason:** Greedy algorithms typically involve iterating through data once while making optimal choices at each step. Problems that can be solved in a single pass often align well with greedy algorithms.

### 6. Can the Problem be Solved Without Backtracking?
- **Question:** Can the problem be solved without reconsidering or undoing previous choices?
- **Reason:** Greedy algorithms do not reconsider previous choices once they are made. Problems where choices are independent and do not need to be undone align well with greedy approaches.

### Example Problems Suitable for Greedy Algorithms:

1. **Coin Change Problem (Minimum Coins):**
   - **Question:** Can the problem of finding the minimum number of coins to make a given amount be solved by selecting the largest denomination that fits at each step?
   - **Yes:** Use a greedy algorithm to select the largest denomination until the amount is reached.

2. **Activity Selection Problem (Maximum Activities):**
   - **Question:** Can the problem of selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities be solved by selecting the earliest finishing activity at each step?
   - **Yes:** Use a greedy algorithm to select activities based on their finish times.

3. **Huffman Coding (Optimal Prefix Codes):**
   - **Question:** Can the problem of encoding data with the minimum number of bits be solved by building a binary tree from the least frequent characters?
   - **Yes:** Use a greedy algorithm to construct the optimal prefix codes.

### Example Questions and Their Alignment:

1. **Question:** Does the problem involve scheduling tasks to minimize the total completion time?
   - **Yes:** Greedy algorithms can be used to prioritize tasks based on their duration or deadlines.

2. **Question:** Does the problem involve finding the shortest path in a weighted graph?
   - **No:** Greedy algorithms are generally not suitable for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph (use Dijkstra's algorithm instead).

3. **Question:** Does the problem involve partitioning an array into subsets with equal sum?
   - **No:** Greedy algorithms are generally not suitable for partitioning problems where an optimal solution requires global knowledge of all elements.

### Conclusion:

By answering these questions, you can determine whether a greedy algorithm is appropriate for your problem. Greedy algorithms are powerful when the greedy choice property and optimal substructure hold, allowing for efficient and often optimal solutions to certain types of problems.
