# Valid Anagram - Solution 2

```typescript
function isAnagramV2(s: string, t: string): boolean {
  // Sort the strings and compare them
  const sortString = (str: string) => str.split("").sort().join("");
  return sortString(s) === sortString(t);
}
```
The solution provided for `isAnagramV2` utilizes several programming concepts and techniques. Here's a breakdown:

### **1. String Manipulation**
- **Splitting a String:**  
  The input string `s` is split into an array of characters using `str.split("")`.
  
- **Joining a String:**  
  After sorting, the array of characters is joined back into a string using `arr.join("")`.

### **2. Array Manipulation**
- **Sorting:**  
  The array of characters is sorted alphabetically using `arr.sort()`. Sorting is key to comparing two strings for anagram equality since anagrams will have identical sorted character arrays.


### **3. Higher-Order Functions**
- **Defining and Using Helper Functions:**  
  The function `sortString` is defined as a helper function to encapsulate the logic of splitting, sorting, and joining a string. This improves code readability and reusability.

### **4. Comparison**
- **String Comparison:**  
  The sorted strings are compared using the `===` operator. Since sorting standardizes the character order, equality between the two sorted strings implies they are anagrams.

### **5. Algorithmic Techniques**
- **Transform-and-Compare:**  
  This is a common algorithmic technique where inputs are transformed (sorted in this case) to make comparison straightforward.

### **6. Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Splitting a string: \( O(n) \)
  - Sorting the array: \( O(n \log n) \)
  - Joining the string: \( O(n) \)  
  Overall for two strings, the complexity is \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the strings.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) for the temporary arrays created during sorting and splitting.

### **Conceptual Summary**
- **Key Concepts:**
  - String and array manipulation.
  - Sorting and comparison.
  - Encapsulation via helper functions.
  - Algorithm optimization and clean code principles.

This solution is elegant and leverages sorting to simplify the anagram problem effectively. However, for scenarios with large strings where sorting might be expensive, a frequency counter-based approach could be more efficient (\( O(n) \) time complexity).
