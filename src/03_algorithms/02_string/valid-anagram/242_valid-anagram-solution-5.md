# Valid Anagram - Solution 5

```typescript
function areArraysEqual(arr1: any[], arr2: any[]) {
  if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
    return false;
  }
  return arr1.every((value, index) => value === arr2[index]);
}

function isAnagramV5(s: string, t: string): boolean {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
  const sortedS = s.split("").sort();
  const sortedT = t.split("").sort();
  return areArraysEqual(sortedS, sortedT);
}
```

This solution uses multiple programming and algorithmic concepts. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### **1. String Manipulation**
- **Splitting Strings:** 
  - `s.split("")` converts a string into an array of characters. This is useful for sorting and comparing characters.
- **Sorting Strings:**
  - `sort()` is used to arrange characters lexicographically, making it easier to compare two strings for equality.

### **2. Array Manipulation**
- **Comparing Arrays:**
  - The `areArraysEqual` function uses array length checks and `every` for element-wise comparison.
- **Iteration:**
  - The `for-of` loop is used to traverse the characters of a string or array.

### **3. Hash Map for Frequency Counting**
- **Character Count Tracking:**
  - The `Map` data structure (`charCount` in this case) is used to store the frequency of each character in one string.
- **Accessing and Updating Values:**
  - `charCount.get(char)` retrieves the current frequency of a character.
  - `charCount.set(char, count - 1)` decrements the frequency, ensuring the count matches across strings.

### **4. Mathematical Representation of Characters**
- **Index-Based Array Counting:**
  - The use of `letterCounts[i]` for 26 letters assumes a fixed range (e.g., a-z). This maps characters to indices using mathematical operations (e.g., `charCodeAt`).

### **5. Algorithmic Patterns**
- **Sorting-Based Solution:**
  - Sorting two strings ensures that equal strings have the same character order, making comparison straightforward. However, this approach has \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity due to sorting.
- **Frequency Count-Based Solution:**
  - By counting character occurrences, you avoid sorting, reducing the time complexity to \(O(n)\).
- **Two-Pointer Technique:** 
  - In the `areArraysEqual` function, implicit use of indexes (`every` uses an internal index) compares corresponding elements efficiently.

### **6. Edge Case Handling**
- **Early Return on Length Mismatch:**
  - Both functions immediately return `false` if the lengths of the inputs do not match, avoiding unnecessary computation.

### **7. Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Sorting: \(O(n \log n)\)
  - Hash Map Count Comparison: \(O(n)\)
  - Index-Based Count Comparison: \(O(n)\)
- **Space Complexity:**
  - Sorting: \(O(n)\) for the sorted arrays.
  - Hash Map: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the unique character count.
  - Index-Based Counting: \(O(1)\) for the fixed-size array.

### Key Insights
- **Sorting and Hashing are Alternative Approaches:**
  - Sorting is simpler to implement but slower for large inputs.
  - Hash-based counting or index-based counting is more efficient for problems involving character or element frequencies.
  
- **Utility Functions like `areArraysEqual`:**
  - They encapsulate common logic (array comparison) that is reusable across solutions.
